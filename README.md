**Updating to iOS 7 of SpeakHere example using AVAudioSession**

This project is an updating of the example SpeakHere created by Apple for iOS devices. Exactly the version 2.5 (2012-09-10) in [developer.apple.com](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/samplecode/SpeakHere/Introduction/Intro.html "SpeakHere Apple project")

The project made by Apple in 2012 used Audio Session, however Audio Session is deprecated in iOS 7. For that reason, I updated this project with AVAudioSession for iOS 7.0 SDK, so I eliminated these deprecated warnings.
